    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Soft, lightly sweet sugar cookie recipe</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>¾ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, 
            and salt.
        </li>
        <li>Cream the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the sugar 
            and beat until fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed. 
            Add the egg and beat well, then add the vanilla extract, almond extract, 
            and lemon zest and mix again. Add the dry ingredients, 
            one-third at a time, mixing until well combined. 
            Divide the dough into two balls and flatten into disks. 
            Wrap in plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge to chill for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface to ¼-inch thickness. 
            Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. Transfer to the baking 
            sheets and bake, one sheet at a time, for 10 minutes. Let cool on 
            the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to 
            continue cooling. Cool completely before icing.
        </li>
    </ol>
