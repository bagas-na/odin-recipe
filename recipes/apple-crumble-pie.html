    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the crust:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup whole-wheat pastry flour (3.25 ounces)</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour (3.25 ounces), plus more for rolling</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cane sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>½ cup plus 1 tablespoon coconut oil, solid, but still scoopable</li>
        <li>3 to 5 tablespoons ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the crumble topping:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup whole-wheat pastry flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup whole rolled oats</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg, cardamom, or ground ginger</li>
        <li>⅓ cup firm coconut oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the fillings:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds (8 medium) Granny Smith or Gala apples, peeled & thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, 
            sugar, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer half of the flour mixture to a food processor 
            and scoop in the coconut oil by large separate tablespoonfuls,
            about 8. Pulse until the mixture starts to crumble, 12 to 16 pulses, 
            then add the remaining flour and pulse until the mixture resembles 
            coarse sand, about 8 more pulses.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the crumbly dough back to the original bowl. Sprinkle in 
            the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and use a rubber spatula to 
            fold and form the dough until it sticks together in a cohesive ball. 
            Knead the dough a few times to get it to come together in a smooth ball, 
            but be careful not to overwork it. Form the dough into a 1½-inch thick
            disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Place the chilled dough onto a lightly-floured surface, or floured 
            parchment paper. Roll the dough into a 7-inch circle, then flip and 
            dust your surface with a bit more flour before placing it back down. 
            Continue to roll into a 12-inch circle. If the dough is too firm, 
            let it sit for 10 minutes at room temperature. If it’s too sticky, 
            add more flour. If the dough cracks, patch it and continue rolling. 
            Gently transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the overhanging 
            to about ½ inch, then tuck it under and crimp the edges with your 
            fingers.
        </li>
        <li>Lightly cover the pie crust and chill for 30 minutes while you make 
            the crumble topping and filling.
        </li>
        <li>For the crumble topping: In a food processor, pulse together the flour, 
            oats, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and spice until combined. Add the 
            coconut oil and pulse until crumbly. If it's too dry, add cold water 
            1 tablespoon at a time until larger crumbles form. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>For the filling: Preheat the oven to 375°F.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the apples with the lemon juice, vanilla, 
            maple syrup, and cornstarch and toss well to coat. (You could also 
            add a few more pinches of cinnamon, if desired.)
        </li>
        <li>Fill the pie crust with the apple mixture and sprinkle evenly with 
            the crumble topping. Bake for 30 minutes and then lightly cover with 
            foil and rotate the pan in the oven. Bake 15 to 20 more minutes or 
            until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Cool 1 hour at room temperature before serving. Serve with scoops of 
            vanilla ice cream.
        </li>

    </ol>
